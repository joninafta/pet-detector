# pet-detector
Python project using the Raspberry Pi to monitor pets movements inside the house

This project started because I suspected that outsider cats enter our house while we are away (or sleeping) and feed from our cat's food plate.
I decided to use my Raspberry Pi, connect a camera and an motion sensor and each time a movement was record, the camera would take several photos and email them to me.
(I also wanted to learn some basic Python)
